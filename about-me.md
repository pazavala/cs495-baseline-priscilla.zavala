# About Me
- Languages: I have primarily used Python, Java, SQL, and R. I have also used C++ for small projects in previous courses, but not enough to comfortably do an advanced project with the language without some practice/refreshing.

- Experience: Most of my code was from school projects and small personal projects, up until this past summer when I interned at the National Science Foundation (NSF), majory facility, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). During this internship, I learned about their CUPiD software and a few differnet kinds of extreme weather tracking softwares for tracking cyclones. I coded in Python throughout my internship and primarily focused on data analysis and visualization with their weather datasets.

- Largest project/system: The largest system I've worked on was using NCAR's supercomputer Derecho. Even though my main project didn't involve directly working on it the whole time, I still learned how to access and interact with NCAR's HPC systems at the beginning of the summer. 

- Most comfortable: I feel most comfortable working with datasets in Python for data analysis. I feel kind of comfortable working on smaller software development projects in Java and working with APIs.

- Least comfortable: I feel least comfortable working with debugging and writing tests making sure all logic code is covered. I also have some experience working with GUIs, but I still don't feel fully condient working with them independently. 

- Concentration: Data Analytics and Machine Learning
